                     <p>Hello, this is Sravani . I'm currently pursuing my B.Tech(Computer Science and Engineering) 
                    at Aditya Engineering College , Surampalem. My current position is a Fullstack trainee at Technical Hub. My interest towards 
                    Web development is the reason for selecting Fullstack technology in Drive Ready which is 
                    organising by Technical Hub. Actually I like front end more than backend because the 
                    result of front end development is visible to our eyes. Recently I came know that backend 
                    is also interesting. Through the backend development we can observe the functionalities of our
                    front end page.</p>
